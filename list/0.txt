Chapter Title: The Immortal and the Peerless Emperor  

Qin Feng was an immortal, his body impervious to decay, destined to endure through the ages.  

Now, he was nine thousand years old.  

Beneath a canopy of stars, he drank alone, lost in memories of the past.  

In the beginning, he hadn’t known he was immortal. Like any ordinary man, he cultivated, ventured forth, and made many friends.  

Those friends…  

By now, perhaps only two still lived.  

The ones who had died—some had been slain by his own hand, others perished beneath the Heavenly Tribulation of the Dao, and some simply withered away with time.  

Yet there was one… who had succeeded in attaining the Dao, becoming the world’s sole invincible Emperor, reigning supreme across all eras, unmatched in existence!  

And that very friend who had ascended to Emperor…  

Was also the person Qin Feng feared most in this lifetime!  

For though Qin Feng could live forever, he could never attain the Dao and ascend as Emperor. Unable to reach that supreme realm, he could never be truly invincible.  

He would never be a match for that man.  

What would happen if the secret of his immortality were discovered by the world’s unrivaled Emperor?  

Qin Feng couldn’t quite imagine, so he had hidden himself away long ago.  

Fortunately, he possessed a natural ability to obscure fate and sever karma—a passive power as inexplicable as his immortality itself.  

Coupled with other methods he had devised…  

He had remained well-hidden all these years.  

Yet deep down, he wasn’t entirely confident. He didn’t know the limits of his concealment—whether it could withstand the scrutiny of a being of such supreme power.  

At least, no mishaps had occurred so far.  

He often sighed, wondering if this was all just a cruel joke played by the heavens.  

Once, they had been sworn brothers, bound by life and death.  

One had become invincible, yet might not live forever.  

The other had gained immortality, yet could never be unrivaled.  

If eternal life didn’t mean invincibility, did it still fall short?  

And conversely…  

If supreme power couldn’t grant immortality, was that not an even greater shortcoming?  

"In the end, this era will belong only to you… and me."  

Qin Feng raised his cup to the starry sky, as if speaking to that old friend—the one whose divine might now shook the heavens, who alone could overturn eternity.  

Meanwhile…  

Yuan You, the invincible ruler of this age, revered as the Supreme Yuan Emperor, was also reminiscing with his wife.  

Mostly because she, too, was nearing her end. Before death, one always lingers on memories of old faces and bygone days.  

Naturally, their conversation turned to Qin Feng.  

"A’You, of all our companions back then… those who were meant to die have died, those destined to become Emperor have succeeded, and the one who wished to marry you did so."  

"For better or worse, we’ve all met our fates."  

"But there’s one person—the one who vanished long ago—what became of him?"  

Hua Mengjin leaned against Yuan You, savoring these final moments of warmth and tranquility.  

She had always been breathtakingly beautiful, once the most dazzling beauty beneath the stars. Even now, her grace remained undimmed.  

Yet the faint silver in her hair betrayed the passage of time, and the weight of mortality clung to her. She didn’t have many years left.  

Yuan You knew exactly who she meant.  

"Qin Feng…"  

At the mention of that name, though his expression remained calm, a flicker of youthful sharpness surfaced in his brow.  

Once, they had been reckless youths together, drinking beneath the stars, boasting of conquering the world, vowing to become invincible, to live forever, to purge all suffering from existence!  

But when it came to Qin Feng…  

Yuan You harbored far more complicated feelings.  

In his mind, they were locked in some unspoken contest—even if he wasn’t entirely sure Qin Feng was still alive.  

"You never wanted to talk about him before."  

"Back then, he was one of the most promising candidates to attain the Dao. Yet he disappeared without a trace."  

"Weren’t you sworn brothers? Couldn’t you even find out if he’s alive or dead?"  

Hua Mengjin pressed.  

In the past, she hadn’t cared much, sensing her husband’s reluctance to discuss Qin Feng. But now, with death looming, she wanted answers.  

"He chose to vanish. He lived for a long time—might even still be alive now."  

Yuan You’s tone was indifferent, but in truth, he wasn’t certain.  

This was merely an intuition—a faint glimmer of insight granted by his supreme Emperor’s power.  

Hazy, unverifiable… yet he believed that man had not died after disappearing. At the very least, he had lingered for many years.  

"Then why has he never reappeared?"  

Hua Mengjin couldn’t help but ask.  

"If someone hides and refuses to show themselves, it’s because they’re afraid of something."  

Yuan You chuckled, a trace of disdainful amusement in his voice—as if he had won some long-standing rivalry against an old comrade who always opposed him.  

"Afraid of what?" Hua Mengjin pondered, then quickly understood.  

In his prime, Qin Feng had been a true pinnacle existence, just one step away from Emperorhood.  

The only things that could frighten him were either the forbidden beings lurking in darkness… or Yuan You himself, now the reigning Emperor.  

But since Yuan You’s ascension, those forbidden creatures dared not emerge. Even if they did, he would stand against them.  

Yet Qin Feng had never resurfaced. So who, then, could he possibly fear?  

"He’s afraid of you? But why?"  

Hua Mengjin’s curiosity deepened. What had happened between these two that she didn’t know?  

"I don’t know. Perhaps he has some secret he doesn’t want me to discover."  

"And I suspect… he thinks me a petty man. An insult I find rather irritating."  

Yuan You’s voice cooled, his Emperor’s aura unconsciously weighing upon the world, casting the surrounding stars into a frigid silence!  

"A petty man? What do you mean?"  

Hua Mengjin was momentarily confused.  

"I imagine he fears I covet his secret, so he hides like a coward."  

"Does that not imply he sees me as some greedy villain?"  

"Whatever secret he guards, I care not. I, Yuan You, need nothing but myself!"  

His voice boomed, eyes blazing with divine light as if piercing through eternity. The aura of an invincible Emperor unfurled, pressing down upon the cosmos, shaking the heavens!  

With his unshakable conviction, he believed he could overturn all of history itself!  

No secret, no matter how profound, held any worth in his eyes!  

He was the absolute pinnacle of existence—nothing in all creation could surpass him!  

If even he couldn’t achieve something, what use was adding Qin Feng to the equation?  

This was the confidence of an Emperor—flawless, unyielding, utterly indifferent to Qin Feng’s so-called secrets!  

"So… you’ve never tried to seek him out?"  

Hua Mengjin finally asked.  

She more or less grasped the situation between Yuan You and Qin Feng.  

Though it was all speculation, with no real evidence…  

Perhaps Qin Feng had other reasons for seclusion. Perhaps he had died long ago.  

But when the words came from the reigning Emperor, even conjecture carried the weight of truth.  

"Never."  

Yuan You smiled faintly. He truly had never searched for Qin Feng.  

The moment he sensed Qin Feng was hiding from him—fearing him—he had dismissed the fool entirely.  

Again, it didn’t matter what treasure or secret that idiot guarded so jealously.  

He. Did. Not. Care.  

He was the Emperor, destined to crush all beneath his might!  

"Then he truly is a petty man, skulking in the void, projecting his own cowardice onto you—a true sovereign."  

Hua Mengjin chuckled softly.  

Perhaps Qin Feng did possess some earth-shattering secret. Perhaps he was already dead.  

But so what?  

Yuan You didn’t care, so neither did she.  

And this, in essence, was the contest Yuan You had engaged in.  

He would never seek Qin Feng out. He would never pry into his secrets.  

He would remain as he was—unshaken, unrivaled.  

As for Qin Feng?  

"Stay hidden. Stay forgotten."  

Far, far away, amidst the stars…  

That immortal "petty man" also sensed the sudden surge of the Emperor’s divine might, rippling across the cosmos.  

With a disdainful snort, he muttered:  

"What’s his problem now? So what if he’s an Emperor? Disturbing the peace like some noisy brat…"
